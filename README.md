I was given a challenging task by a cutting-edge pathology lab that has developed a revolutionary method for processing histological images. This method employs efficient stochastic sampling to analyze 20 key features rapidly, surpassing traditional techniques and excluding the 'worst' features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

The lab seeks a powerful machine learning solution to:

Achieve at least 90% accuracy in detecting malignant cancer.
Ensure no more than 20% false positives in benign cases.
With 220 meticulously hand-labeled samples, the goal is to create a robust model that enhances the speed and precision of cancer diagnostics, setting a new standard in healthcare.
